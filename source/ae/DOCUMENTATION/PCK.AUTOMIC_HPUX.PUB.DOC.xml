<DOC><![CDATA[With the HP-Unix action you can install, upgrade, remove and query installed packages on your UNIX host. 

The actions are in general wrappers around the swinstall, swremove and swlist command line tools.

=Rollback=

The actions getting some system information don't need rollbacks, because they do not change the state of your system. Such a method is QUERY.
